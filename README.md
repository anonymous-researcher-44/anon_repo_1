Code for Reproducibility

There are three primary python notebooks

- simulated_example.ipynb
- play_delay_example.ipynb
- power_comparison.ipynb

These notebooks contain computationally intensive simulations.
The output of these simulations have benen stored as .pkl files.
To bypass reperforming the simulations, one can simply skip the cells in the notebook, and proceed to the cell which reads from the .pkl files.

The real dataset is playdelay.csv
